# The Kirk ATM

<h2>Description</h2>

This website was created as part of the MITxEmeritus course.

I created an ATM app that enables users to deposit or withdraw funds. If there are insufficient funds for a withdrawal, an alert will let the user know.

<h2>How to Run</h2>

This project must be loaded using a server (run "http-server -c-1" from the terminal in order to open a server that will not cache items).

<h2>Roadmap of Future Improvements</h2>

I intend to continue developing the UI for this page. I'd like to make it more attractive and to experiment with styles further.
